This [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) add-on installs the
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server. It does not provide any integrations.

Server is exposed on port `8096`.

Configuration and caches are stored on `share` (not in config), therefore
its data will not be deleted when add-on is uninstalled, and must be deleted
manually. This is intentional.
